## Clock

This clock application is developed to explore Next JS and learn how to use plain JS in React Environment,
this application could be built faster in plain JS but here it's more reliable, more expandable but way harder to develop.
Also I used it to learn typescript, redux and Jest.
I am happy to share this project because I think it turned out to be looking great,
this repo shows that very basic projects can have much bigger backend.
